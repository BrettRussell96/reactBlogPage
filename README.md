# React Blog App
Decided to build a very basic frent-end blog app using React. The main purpose of this project was to develop more fluency with class component syntax. In future I will be focusing more on function component syntax, specifically using hooks, however, I wanted to have some practice with classes incase I ever work with a team on an older existing project that still uses them.
